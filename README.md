A simple FPS training game and WASD/mouse movement trainer to help my girlfriend learn how to game.

## Features
- Move with WASD keys

1. Click anywhere on the game screen to lock the mouse and start playing.
2. Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around.
3. Collect stars and shoot targets to increase your score.
4. Press ESC to unlock the mouse and show instructions.

This project was created as a fun way to introduce FPS controls and basic gaming skills.

## Our Story: Getting Started with Gaming

It all began when we started playing the game "Peak" together. Watching her curiosity and excitement as she explored the world of games was truly heartwarming. We laughed at the silly mistakes, celebrated every little victory, and bonded over the challenge of learning something new. Inspired by those moments, I wanted to create a simple FPS trainer to make the transition to keyboard and mouse gaming even more fun and approachable. This project is a small gift to help her (and anyone else new to gaming) feel confident and enjoy the journey!
